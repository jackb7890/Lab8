1. After unzipping prog08_jcb5464_waa493.zip, type the make command to compile the plagiarismChecker.cpp (driver file) and fnameFinder.cpp (system-level funtion file).
2. Run the executable ./plagariasmChecker with the following parameters
	Parameter 1) path to directory containing documents to check (NOTE: Only include documents needed to be checked or an error may occur)
	Parameter 2) the size of chunks to be checked (A size of 6 has been found to produce reliable results)
	Parameter 3) the lower bound of similar chunks to be printed (If 200 is passed for this parameter, only files that share more than 200 chunks will be printed)
All parameters must be given a value

MORE INFO:
-This program does not run the large document set in a reasonable amount of time
-This program uses a selection sort and can be sped up with other sorts
